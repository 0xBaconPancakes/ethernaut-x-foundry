## Info

Individual Levels can be found in their repspective folders in ./src ie Fallback is located in ./src/Fallback.sol

Tests for each level can be found in ./src/test/[LEVEL_NAME].t.sol ie ./src/test/Fallback.t.sol

The Factory contracts can be ignored ie ./src/FallbackFactory.sol They are unrelated to the "players" task but required for the Ethernaut core contracts which enable us to verify we have passed the level.

The ./src/Ethernaut.sol & ./src/BaseLevel.sol are also part of the Ethernaut core contracts and so can be ignored by the "player".
